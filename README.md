# Applied-AI-Foundations
An introudction to your AI Journey

Sumudu Tennakoon, Ph.D.

## Course Description
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are reshaping industries through predictive analytics, automation, and generative applications. This course builds a strong foundation in supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and responsible AI, with hands-on practice in Python. A key emphasis is placed on building AI applications and agents with Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI equipping learners to design and deploy cutting-edge solutions. By the end, participants will be able to define AI/ML problems, create solution pathways, and deliver end-to-end applications, culminating in a capstone project that demonstrates both technical skill and responsible innovation.
