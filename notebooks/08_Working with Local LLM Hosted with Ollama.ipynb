      "The sky appears blue to us because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century. Here's a simplified explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere**: When the sun's rays enter our atmosphere, they encounter tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2).\n",
      "2. **Molecules scatter the light**: These gas molecules scatter the shorter, blue wavelengths of sunlight more than the longer, red wavelengths. This is because the smaller molecules are more effective at scattering the energy.\n",
      "3. **Blue light dominates**: As a result of this scattering, the blue light is dispersed in all directions, making it the dominant color we see in the sky during the daytime.\n",
      "4. **Red light continues to travel straight**: The longer wavelengths of sunlight, like red and orange, continue to travel in a straight line, reaching our eyes from deeper in the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "This scattering effect is more pronounced when the sun is high in the sky, as it provides more opportunities for the molecules to interact with the light. However, during sunrise and sunset, the angle of the sun's rays changes, and the shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) are scattered more, giving the sky its characteristic warm colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that the color of the sky can vary depending on factors like atmospheric conditions, pollution, and the time of day. But in general, the Rayleigh scattering effect is responsible for why the sky appears blue to us.\n"

He also pioneered the concept of mass-energy equivalence, as demonstrated by his famous equation E = mc². Marie Curie, on the other hand, was a pioneering physicist and chemist who discovered the elements polonium and radium through her groundbreaking research on radioactivity. Max Planck introduced the concept of quanta, leading to the formulation of the Planck constant and earning him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918.\n",
